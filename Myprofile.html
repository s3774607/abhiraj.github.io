                <h4>My name is Abhiraj Singh<br>
Student ID – s3774607<br>
Student email – s3774607@student.rmit.edu.au
</h4>

<p>Hi, you can actually call me Abhi. I am a student in RMIT University studying bachelors of IT. I am an international student for India which makes me an Indian by nationality. I belong from the state of Punjab and Punjabi is my culture. I am Sikh by religion but the only religion me and my family believes in is Humanity. I completed my grade 12 from Sat Paul Mittal School which is ranked 5Th in the whole of India and renowned for its excellent results and study culture. I can say I know a number languages starting with English as my primary language and Punjabi, Hindi, French and Mandarin as some of my secondary languages. The one fact I believe others may find interesting about me is that I have been a Project Manager in a company named Time To Save Pty Ltd from the age of 19 and has been handling all its operations since. I play table tennis as my favourite sport and cam 3rd in the state championship back in 2015. I would read about something new happening in the world rather than sitting free in my pastime.</p>
<br>
<br>
<h2 class="heading">Interest in IT:</h2>
<p>I was always fascinated by the new inventions in the technological world and wanted build something like a software, an application helping people save energy and guide them towards the schemes helping them upgrade to recyclable energy and saving bills.
   My interest in IT started at a very early age but, I was 16 when I made it a final decision to study IT and pursue my dream.</p>
<p>As I love reading about the new things happening around the world, I came across the article about the Victorian Energy Upgrades Scheme, it was about everything federal and state government is doing to save energy by subsidizing rebates in different activities such as upgrading the old Mercury Vapour High wattage lamps to lower wattage brighter new technology LED lights which do not emit any harmful radiations and also reduce the energy consumptions. The scheme was introduced with the activity to change everything non-LED in residential and commercial premises to LED and reduce energy consumption to less than four times of the original. This generated my interest where I started thinking in new ways to combine IT and Energy saving and generate something to help people.</p>
<p>I have always wanted to live near the city when I was planning on studying in an abroad country, I decided Melbourne as the city where I wanted to be graduated was because my dad as well graduated from La Trobe University and he always wanted me to learn and enjoy the culture of Australia. Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology as the name states is a renowned university in its information technology sector, it also suited with my other wish to live near the city and my university itself being in the centre of the city with Victoria Library and Melbourne Central just next to it made it a clear choice.</p>
<p>I trust my university and their incredible staff who have been very supportive and helpful. My expectations with studying my course in RMIT are quite high and I am sure that the university I have chosen will help achieve my goal one day to help people around the world and make this planet greener, abundant and only running on renewable energy. Until now my experience has been great, even during the hard times of COVID-19 the online classes were made fun and interesting.</p>
