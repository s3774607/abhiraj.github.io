                <h4>My name is Abhiraj Singh<br>
Student ID – s3774607<br>
Student email – s3774607@student.rmit.edu.au
</h4>

<p>Hi, you can actually call me Abhi. I am a student in RMIT University studying bachelors of IT. I am an international student for India which makes me an Indian by nationality. I belong from the state of Punjab and Punjabi is my culture. I am Sikh by religion but the only religion me and my family believes in is Humanity. I completed my grade 12 from Sat Paul Mittal School which is ranked 5Th in the whole of India and renowned for its excellent results and study culture. I can say I know a number languages starting with English as my primary language and Punjabi, Hindi, French and Mandarin as some of my secondary languages. The one fact I believe others may find interesting about me is that I have been a Project Manager in a company named Time To Save Pty Ltd from the age of 19 and has been handling all its operations since. I play table tennis as my favourite sport and cam 3rd in the state championship back in 2015. I would read about something new happening in the world rather than sitting free in my pastime.</p>
<br>
<br>
<h2 class="heading">Interest in IT:</h2>
<p>I was always fascinated by the new inventions in the technological world and wanted build something like a software, an application helping people save energy and guide them towards the schemes helping them upgrade to recyclable energy and saving bills.
   My interest in IT started at a very early age but, I was 16 when I made it a final decision to study IT and pursue my dream.</p>
<p>As I love reading about the new things happening around the world, I came across the article about the Victorian Energy Upgrades Scheme, it was about everything federal and state government is doing to save energy by subsidizing rebates in different activities such as upgrading the old Mercury Vapour High wattage lamps to lower wattage brighter new technology LED lights which do not emit any harmful radiations and also reduce the energy consumptions. The scheme was introduced with the activity to change everything non-LED in residential and commercial premises to LED and reduce energy consumption to less than four times of the original. This generated my interest where I started thinking in new ways to combine IT and Energy saving and generate something to help people.</p>
<p>I have always wanted to live near the city when I was planning on studying in an abroad country, I decided Melbourne as the city where I wanted to be graduated was because my dad as well graduated from La Trobe University and he always wanted me to learn and enjoy the culture of Australia. Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology as the name states is a renowned university in its information technology sector, it also suited with my other wish to live near the city and my university itself being in the centre of the city with Victoria Library and Melbourne Central just next to it made it a clear choice.</p>
<p>I trust my university and their incredible staff who have been very supportive and helpful. My expectations with studying my course in RMIT are quite high and I am sure that the university I have chosen will help achieve my goal one day to help people around the world and make this planet greener, abundant and only running on renewable energy. Until now my experience has been great, even during the hard times of COVID-19 the online classes were made fun and interesting.</p>

<p>With results I have received by giving these three tests, I am completely convinced that these are correct and show exactly like how I think and take my decisions. I think like the Myers-Briggs test states I should be a commander leading the team where I can take responsible decisions and make myself and team proud of our work together. These should be taken into account while making a team because every team needs one leader and one of each kind of member where these tests help make a team which is highly efficient and effective when working on a project.</p> <br>
<br>
<br>
<h2 class="heading">Project Idea</h2>

<p>The project is to design a mobile application that can track people’s usage of energy in their commercial and residential properties by simply putting the product name and model of lights and other appliances they are using. The application would also suggest the users about the different rebate schemes from the government and how they can avail them to reduce their energy consumptions just by simply using the products approved under this scheme. This will also allow the users to contact the certified suppliers of these products. The app be built using swift language for IOS users and java for android users.
<br>
<br>
The project will be very fun, interesting and useful at the same time because the target audience is very large which nearly includes every individual living in Victoria. A research includes that there are about 4 million households in Victoria which gives us a basic start of users. Developing an application which is free on App store and Google play will attract people and help the AP’s grow in business and helping government to advance their country. Overall, the application will be highly productive for reducing greenhouse emissions, generation of carbon certificates in the form of Victorian Energy Efficiency Certificates (VEECs) and advancement in technology. <br>
<br>
The end product application will be named as EnergySaversAu giving the users a proud moment of being an energy saver for their country. The application is meant to start with a welcome page stating the facts how much energy is consumed on an average by Victorians every day of their daily lives and how much can be saved just clicking through some simple button’s in the application. The application will then go on with asking the user about some basic information of the products they are already using in their commercial or residential premises. The boxes of information would just ask for the brand of the product already installed and the model number to calculate the annual usage and savings with the new product. If the product is already energy saving it would show a thank you screen to give applaud to the users for being an energy saver. If the product can be changed to a better product under the government scheme, it would provide the user with information about the latest products and a list Accredited Providers of the products. Once the user has decided on choosing the new product, they would be asked to fill in some basic details like their full name, mobile number, address and email for the AP’s to contact them and quickly book an appointment for their upgrade. Once the contact details have been received, the information would be traded with the AP’s for commissions on the leads provided by the applications which would help fund the working of the application and still making it free for users to use. The users would also be given an option to calculate savings with the new product before installation and also provide them with the complete specification documents. The application would be updated with the new products added in the scheme via the updates of the app. The user can also sign up for weekly or monthly updates of the new additions and changes in the rebate scheme. If a user has gone through an upgrade with the application, they would be provided with a job ID which they can also use as their reference number and if any problem occurs with the products can either contact through the application itself with 24/7 chat and call support or contact the AP directly in their business hours. If the AP’s don’t act on their promises, the user also has the power to report and provide evidence of the unlawful behaviour of the provider directly to the government by submitting a complaint to Essential Services Committee portal which would be connected with the application itself.
<br>
In the end, the application can not only help users in saving energy on their premises but helping government keep a track of which premises have already been upgraded and regulate their energy bills with energy providers so there is not duplication by the AP’s and help generate a generous source of income for the developers.<br>
<br>
The major tools required for the building the application are Xcode for the swift language coding for IOS app development and ItelliJ for java language coding for Android app development. We would be needing a Mac OS operating system because xcode is only available on apple devices and moreover for the testing of the app one is required whereas it goes for the android app we can develop it on either mac or windows operating machine. We would also be needing Mongo Db to connect the user data to a database to store all the data over a cloud which can be used over different devices and also to store the data of the products. An AWS setup would also be needed to connect everything in cloud.<br>
<br>
In developing the app some skills such as knowledge about front-end and back-end developing would be required in both the languages being used. Also, the developers should have the basic knowledge connecting both the ends meet and should have knowledge cloud computing. A lot of testing would also be involved during the development. Privacy of the user also needs to be accounted on because the app at one point would be collecting user’s personal data.<br>
<br>
If the project remains successful as planned it would help millions of Victorians overcome the problem of high amount of money, they have been paying all these years and not upgrading to a newer technology covered under the government rebate scheme. The impact would be very positive because it would create a win-win situation for Government, users, stakeholders, AP’s and the product owner. Keeping the environment in mind it is a very helpful app to prevent our planet Earth by reducing greenhouse emissions and save the non-renewable and diminishing assets we have.<br>
